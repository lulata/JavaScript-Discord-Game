As the night begins to drip away, the darkness faded in, seeping into every crack that it could find.
The kingdom of Aglacia had been in peaceful prosperity for the last 20 centuries, yet for some reason,
the darkness had chosen to come now. The King was in distress. His forces were stretched thin, the people
were scared, nobody was willing to be in the army. Just as he began to think all hope was lost, heroes
from all over, came to the kingdom and volunteered to help. The King readily accepted, but the following
day was slain by the dark sorcerer. The heroes fled into the nearby villages, hoping that the sorcerer's
wrath would one day calm down, but after 10 years, he still did not calm down, and the heroes decided it
was time to rise up against him. This is your legacy, and what you shall rise up to become.
